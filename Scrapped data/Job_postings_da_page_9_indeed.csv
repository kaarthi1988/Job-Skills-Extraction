The GEF unites 186 countries in partnership with international institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector to address global environmental issues while supporting national sustainable development initiatives. An independently operating financial organization, GEF is the designated financial mechanism for five multilateral environmental conventions: The Convention on Biological Diversity, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Convention to Combat Desertification, and Minamata Convention on Mercury. GEF was also recently designated to serve as part of the financial mechanism of the international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ).

The MEA and Funds Division is also responsible for strategy development and implementation for the funds, along with managing major environmental negotiations and anchoring the relevant work on all COP negotiations. A key function of the MEA and Funds division is the coordination of the MEAs and working with other funds such as the Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund to promote synergies and to collaborate on programming.
