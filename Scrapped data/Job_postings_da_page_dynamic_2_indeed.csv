The analyst will work with biostatisticians to execute data analyses. Current Major Projects
    
Supporting, Mobilizing, and Accelerating Research for Tuberculosis Elimination (SMART4TB) Technical Area 5 (TB Vaccine Readiness) Consortium Studies – This USAID-funded project is conducting mixed-methods research in up to six high TB burden countries to evaluate current levels of, and factors influencing, demand and acceptance of new TB vaccines targeting adults and adolescents. It also assesses the readiness of health facilities and health systems to introduce and sustain the delivery of such vaccines. Data collection will commence in Kenya and South Africa this year, with plans to expand to up to four additional countries over the next four years. Key skills of interest include international field site management, data management, data analysis, and preference research methods (e.g., discrete choice experiments [DCE] and best-worst scaling [BWS]). If desired, the project offers opportunities to engage in qualitative research data collection and analysis, and to apply participatory research approaches to co-design dissemination products for diverse in-country stakeholders, integrating the formative vaccine data.
Investigating a Novel Targeted Rollout Strategy for Adult and Adolescent TB Vaccines for Maximum Impact (INTRO-TB-VAX Study) - This Gates-funded project is conducting research in up to three high TB burden countries to: (1) identify the highest-yield venues for potential vaccine delivery (e.g., health facilities, schools, markets, bars, prisons, churches, and other community settings); (2) prioritize key barriers to delivering TB vaccines at these venues—at both individual and structural levels—that must be addressed before vaccine availability; and (3) describe the implementation conditions under which novel TB vaccines are likely to achieve the greatest impact and cost-effectiveness. The project will begin data collection in Zambia early next year, with plans to expand to up to two additional countries over the following year. Skills of interest include international field site management, data management, data analysis, and preference research methods (e.g., discrete choice experiments [DCE] and best-worst scaling [BWS]). If desired, the project offers opportunities to engage in qualitative research data collection and analysis, costing data collection, and impact and cost-effectiveness modeling.

We are seeking to add to our entrepreneurial culture and team with an eCommerce Data Analyst.

 Position Description:
The eCommerce Data Analyst at Blueair will play a pivotal role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. This position involves maintaining a single source of truth by integrating data from various sources, creating executive dashboards, and presenting findings to business leaders and the C-suite. The analyst will collaborate with cross-functional teams to share insights and support strategic initiatives, while also owning the Business Analytics data ecosystem to ensure a robust data foundation.

This role is hybrid and requires applicants to live in the following states: IL, IN, NY, NJ and be willing to commute to a local office (Chicago/NYC) two days a week. 

Responsibilities and Functions:

Data Management: Maintain a single source of truth for data by integrating information from multiple sources, ensuring accuracy and accessibility.
Dashboard Creation: Design and develop executive dashboards to provide actionable insights to business leaders and stakeholders.
Reporting & Stakeholder Engagement: Maintain various data reports and conduct regular meetings with stakeholders to review data trends, propose actions, and drive decision-making.

About the Company:
We are looking to add to our entrepreneurial culture and team. Here, employees are challenged to perform at a high level while helping the company grow and are given the opportunity to excel and grow themselves. Blueair is constantly in pursuit of opportunities that strengthen our cause to support and enhance the education and betterment of air quality for people around the world.

 Our Take on Leadership:
 Growth Mindset: This is competitive leadership. Taking the lead in the marketplace versus following. It's a positive attitude about the company's future — glass half-full —but it's realistic. It's passion for winning. Winning defined as gaining market share. It's placing a fresh emphasis on innovation — challenging the status quo.
 Consumer and Customer Focus: This is purpose-driven leadership. It's externally focused — on consumers, on customers. First take care of consumers and customers; financial performance will follow. It's a heightened passion for the consumer: “I firmly believe in improving the lives of consumers.” It's bringing the voice of the consumer and the customer into everything we do. It's seeing our brands through their eyes.
 Bias for action: This is action-driven leadership: ""This is what I will do."" It's speed and sense of urgency in making decisions. But it needs to be thoughtful action, intelligent risk-taking. Also, it's not wasting time on bureaucracy — it’s output that counts. And it’s simplifying my agenda, carefully choosing priorities — and not taking on too much.
 Accountability and Responsibility: This is performance-driven leadership. ""I will deliver against KPIs, holding myself to the highest standards.” I will also hold other people accountable — first by setting clear expectations and then by telling them if they are on the right path. It's staring reality in the eye — doing it with numbers. It's taking responsibility for Blueair's overall performance, not just by delivering my results but by helping other people deliver their results. Finally, it’s personally driving change and using operational discipline to deliver on the promise.
 Building Talent and Teams: This is people-driven leadership. It's passion for people. It's having the best people in the right positions, whatever the person's gender or background. It's giving people plenty of room to do their part and recognizing them for their contributions. It's investing in people's development — giving them feedback and challenging work. It’s also constantly challenging myself to grow and improve. And it's building aligned, cohesive teams that pull together to win.

 If you consider yourself a go-getter who loves to #win, and someone who loves to have fun, then we may have the job for you.

 Blueair is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. You will be considered for this position based upon your experience and education, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, ancestry; marital, disabled, or veteran status.

Blueair is constantly in pursuit of opportunities that strengthen our cause to support and enhance the education and betterment of air quality for people around the world.

 Our Take on Leadership:
 Growth Mindset: This is competitive leadership. Taking the lead in the marketplace versus following. It's a positive attitude about the company's future — glass half-full —but it's realistic. It's passion for winning. Winning defined as gaining market share. It's placing a fresh emphasis on innovation — challenging the status quo.
 Consumer and Customer Focus: This is purpose-driven leadership. It's externally focused — on consumers, on customers. First take care of consumers and customers; financial performance will follow. It's a heightened passion for the consumer: “I firmly believe in improving the lives of consumers.” It's bringing the voice of the consumer and the customer into everything we do. It's seeing our brands through their eyes.
 Bias for action: This is action-driven leadership: ""This is what I will do."" It's speed and sense of urgency in making decisions. But it needs to be thoughtful action, intelligent risk-taking. Also, it's not wasting time on bureaucracy — it’s output that counts. And it’s simplifying my agenda, carefully choosing priorities — and not taking on too much.
 Accountability and Responsibility: This is performance-driven leadership. ""I will deliver against KPIs, holding myself to the highest standards.” I will also hold other people accountable — first by setting clear expectations and then by telling them if they are on the right path. It's staring reality in the eye — doing it with numbers. It's taking responsibility for Blueair's overall performance, not just by delivering my results but by helping other people deliver their results. Finally, it’s personally driving change and using operational discipline to deliver on the promise.
 Building Talent and Teams: This is people-driven leadership. It's passion for people. It's having the best people in the right positions, whatever the person's gender or background. It's giving people plenty of room to do their part and recognizing them for their contributions. It's investing in people's development — giving them feedback and challenging work. It’s also constantly challenging myself to grow and improve. And it's building aligned, cohesive teams that pull together to win.

 If you consider yourself a go-getter who loves to #win, and someone who loves to have fun, then we may have the job for you.

 Blueair is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. You will be considered for this position based upon your experience and education, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, ancestry; marital, disabled, or veteran status.
