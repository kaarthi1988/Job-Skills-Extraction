The Board consists of 15 members who are appointed by the Mayor, the City Council, and Public Advocate or designated by the police commissioner. The Board is responsible for governing the agency. The Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the agency. As the largest police oversight agency in the United States, the CCRB currently investigates approximately 4,500 complaints each year.  In April 2021, the New York City Council passed Local Law 47, which clarified that the CCRB has the authority, under its abuse of authority jurisdiction, to investigate civilian complaints against New York City police officers alleging racial profiling and other forms of biased policing based on race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, immigration, or housing status.  To execute this newly clarified authority, the CCRB has created a Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing (RPBP) Investigations Unit. The RPBP Unit has built a team of skilled and experienced investigators, investigating attorneys, and data analysts to handle these biased policing investigations, which are often complex. The RPBP Unit’s investigations include quantitative analyses of various NYPD and New York City datasets to identify potential patterns of biased conduct. To help support this work, the RPBP Unit seeks a full-time Data Analyst. Reporting to the Chief Data Scientist of the Unit, the Data Analyst will help to design and conduct these analyses and report their results in a clear, comprehensible way to agency staff and CCRB Board members.   The Data Analyst’s responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to: 

Compiling and cleaning various NYPD and New York City datasets
Analyzing officer-level, command-level, and department-wide NYPD datasets to identify potential patterns of biased police conduct
Explaining analyses and presenting findings clearly to non-technical audiences in writing and orally
Creating maps to aid investigations of civilian complaints
Working with RPBP Unit staff to identify and request necessary data from the NYPD and other entities
Reading and summarizing academic papers and/or government reports related to policing in New York City
Assisting the Chief Data Scientist, Director, and Deputy Director of the RPBP Unit with the drafting and publication of reports on racial profiling and biased policing

Job Description




      The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is charged with investigating, mediating, and prosecuting complaints that members of the public file against New York City police officers alleging the use of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, offensive language, untruthful statements made by officers, and racial profiling and biased policing. The Board consists of 15 members who are appointed by the Mayor, the City Council, and Public Advocate or designated by the police commissioner. The Board is responsible for governing the agency. The Executive Director is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the agency. As the largest police oversight agency in the United States, the CCRB currently investigates approximately 4,500 complaints each year.  In April 2021, the New York City Council passed Local Law 47, which clarified that the CCRB has the authority, under its abuse of authority jurisdiction, to investigate civilian complaints against New York City police officers alleging racial profiling and other forms of biased policing based on race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, immigration, or housing status.  To execute this newly clarified authority, the CCRB has created a Racial Profiling and Bias-Based Policing (RPBP) Investigations Unit. The RPBP Unit has built a team of skilled and experienced investigators, investigating attorneys, and data analysts to handle these biased policing investigations, which are often complex. The RPBP Unit’s investigations include quantitative analyses of various NYPD and New York City datasets to identify potential patterns of biased conduct. To help support this work, the RPBP Unit seeks a full-time Data Analyst. Reporting to the Chief Data Scientist of the Unit, the Data Analyst will help to design and conduct these analyses and report their results in a clear, comprehensible way to agency staff and CCRB Board members.   The Data Analyst’s responsibilities may include, but will not be limited to: 

Compiling and cleaning various NYPD and New York City datasets
Analyzing officer-level, command-level, and department-wide NYPD datasets to identify potential patterns of biased police conduct

Creating maps to aid investigations of civilian complaints
Working with RPBP Unit staff to identify and request necessary data from the NYPD and other entities
Reading and summarizing academic papers and/or government reports related to policing in New York City
