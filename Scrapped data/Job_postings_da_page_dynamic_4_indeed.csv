Position Summary



Hello, we’re Metro! Metro is dedicated to shaping a better future for the greater Portland region. The work the people of Metro do every day benefits the lives of the people who live here, today, and tomorrow.
The Finance & Regulatory Services (FRS) department is looking for a Budget and Financial Analyst to support Planning, Development and Research (PDR).
We are looking for someone with budget development experience, strong analytical and financial reporting skills, and an interest in finding areas for improvement and developing processes. As federal grants represent a significant source of PDR’s annual funding, the Budget and Financial Analyst will have experience with federal award compliance requirements and grant budgeting.
This position works closely with colleagues as part of a five-person finance team. PD&R’s work has a significant impact on our region: transportation planning as the region’s Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), programs that support equitable development and regional land use policies, as well as a Research Center that provides data, analysis and mapping applications that support decision-making across the region.
Our revenue sources are complex and include federal grant revenue, intergovernmental agreements, and contracts. The successful candidate will be able to show experience managing multiple revenue streams and designing internal controls to ensure compliance with revenue restrictions.


 As the PDR Budget and Financial Analyst you will:



 Budgeting, Reporting and Forecasting


Work alongside the PD&R Finance Manager to develop the annual departmental budget (~$30 million of annual revenue and expense).
Lead the creation of project specific grant budgets and coordinate closely with project staff on new grant proposal submissions, ensuring compliance with donor requirements.
Prepare and analyze regular financial reporting and forecasts to help PDR staff and leadership monitor programs, projects and departmental spending.
Use multiple software programs to run reports and perform reconciliations including budget, financial and payroll. Learn tools of each software and be able to prepare reports and at times customize reports.
Lead the creation of the Unified Planning Work Program (UPWP) budget and bi-annual report, a federally mandated document for Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), collecting project narratives from across the department and ensuring the accompanying financial data supports project narratives.


 Process Improvement and Compliance


Utilize your knowledge of the federal regulations of 2 CFR 200 and General Accepted Accounting Principles to improve departmental processes, develop guidance documents, and respond to requests of support from PDR staff.
Improve processes related to management and tracking of subrecipients, federal grant revenue and other restricted revenue streams.



 Attributes for success


Skill with Microsoft Excel including pivot tables, v-lookups, charts and other tools to analyze data.
Working knowledge of General Accepted Accounting Principles and the federal grant compliance requirements of 2 CFR 200.
Ability to review accuracy of work products and have attention to detail.
Systems thinker with critical thinking and problem-solving ability.
Advanced organizational skills with a proven ability to multi-task in an efficient and effective manner.
A self-starter who is not afraid to roll up their sleeves and do the work that needs to get done.
Ability to establish and maintain effective working relationships and provide quality support to internal and external stakeholders.


 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

    At Metro, we strive to cultivate diversity, advance equity, and practice inclusion in all of its work. This means attracting and empowering a workforce that is inclusive of a broad range of human qualities. Workplace diversity is both a moral imperative and a business strength, essential to providing quality support and services to our region. Metro’s goal is to hire, develop and retain highly skilled and talented individuals across all departments and programs who best reflect the diversity of our community.

Utilize your knowledge of the federal regulations of 2 CFR 200 and General Accepted Accounting Principles to improve departmental processes, develop guidance documents, and respond to requests of support from PDR staff.
Improve processes related to management and tracking of subrecipients, federal grant revenue and other restricted revenue streams.

Skill with Microsoft Excel including pivot tables, v-lookups, charts and other tools to analyze data.
Working knowledge of General Accepted Accounting Principles and the federal grant compliance requirements of 2 CFR 200.
