 Our cultural standards
 These are the core cultural standards to which we hold ourselves & our team-members at Fella:

 Belief in the mission — we will have served 10 million fellas by the end of 2028 (1 million fellas by end of 2026) and we transform the life of most fellas who join. We have a lot of work to do. We are obsessed with our fellas and are dedicated to the mission.
 Bulldozing barriers — the world is malleable and we shape it. We truly believe this and act accordingly. We are relentlessly resourceful and are at the mercy of no-one but ourselves.
 Unwavering integrity — we are at the frontier, so we often live in ambiguity with no trodden path. When we can’t look to others for guidance, we must maintain impeccable ethics and unwavering integrity.
 Enduring frugality — we are frugal. We hate being wasteful and we are anti-luxury. We spend our cash wisely & carefully - in a way that would make our grandmas proud.
 Do what is needed — speed is critical and often the solutions we need are messy. We are comfortable moving quickly and taking on gritty work.
 End-to-end ownership — we are comfortable owning projects from noticing the problem to delivering the outcome.
 Dedication to excellence — we are obsessed with our role, with a commitment to compounding self-improvement.
 Commitment to candor — we believe in open communication and transparency. We are clear & caring communicators, welcoming feedback.
 Only the paranoid survive — the road of expansion is bumpy. We are not fair weather sailers; we embrace the storms. However much we’ve already done, however far we’ve already come — all our work is still ahead of us.
 Keep your head down — we’re boring people doing exciting work. We don’t chase short-term status: we ignore short-term dopamine hits and focus on what matters. Outsiders will underestimate us and we revel in that.

“You just build an amazing experience. Make each step amazing. Make every decision in the long term interest of the fella. Give the fella massively more value than you take.” — a poetic extract from one of our advisors.

 Our cultural standards
 These are the core cultural standards to which we hold ourselves & our team-members at Fella:

 Belief in the mission — we will have served 10 million fellas by the end of 2028 (1 million fellas by end of 2026) and we transform the life of most fellas who join. We have a lot of work to do. We are obsessed with our fellas and are dedicated to the mission.
 Bulldozing barriers — the world is malleable and we shape it. We truly believe this and act accordingly. We are relentlessly resourceful and are at the mercy of no-one but ourselves.
 Unwavering integrity — we are at the frontier, so we often live in ambiguity with no trodden path. When we can’t look to others for guidance, we must maintain impeccable ethics and unwavering integrity.
 Enduring frugality — we are frugal. We hate being wasteful and we are anti-luxury. We spend our cash wisely & carefully - in a way that would make our grandmas proud.
 Do what is needed — speed is critical and often the solutions we need are messy. We are comfortable moving quickly and taking on gritty work.
 End-to-end ownership — we are comfortable owning projects from noticing the problem to delivering the outcome.
 Dedication to excellence — we are obsessed with our role, with a commitment to compounding self-improvement.
 Commitment to candor — we believe in open communication and transparency. We are clear & caring communicators, welcoming feedback.
 Only the paranoid survive — the road of expansion is bumpy. We are not fair weather sailers; we embrace the storms. However much we’ve already done, however far we’ve already come — all our work is still ahead of us.
 Keep your head down — we’re boring people doing exciting work. We don’t chase short-term status: we ignore short-term dopamine hits and focus on what matters. Outsiders will underestimate us and we revel in that.

“You just build an amazing experience. Make each step amazing. Make every decision in the long term interest of the fella. Give the fella massively more value than you take.” — a poetic extract from one of our advisors.

Overview
As a Senior Data BSA/Product Associate on the Transactional Data Products team within Enterprise Data and Analytics, you will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from (1) data architecture design to direct business process evolution, (2) backlog prioritization and management, (3) reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution, (4) researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion, and (5) educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.
Beyond these core competencies it will be very important for this candidate to be comfortable working with remote data science professionals. This assignment will be working specifically to support the recent Acquisition of Celect and onboarding them to existing data products as well as eliciting requirements to build new ones.
If youre right for this role, youre a data evangelist with hands-on SQL experience, agile product experience and a basic understanding of data architecture. In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward, and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a big data cloud eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutioning, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a white board for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

Overview:
The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) is currently accepting applications for the Senior Public Health Data Strategy (SPHDS) Fellowship. Fellowship positions will begin on a rolling basis as they are filled.
The goal of the Senior Data Strategy fellowship is to place professionals with demonstrated skills in data science, informatics, and/or IT in state, local, tribal, or territorial health departments for a time-limited appointment. This appointment is for a full-time position; fellows may not be enrolled in a degree-seeking program or hold employment that would interfere with the full-time work hours of the host site. The Data Strategy fellows will play a critical role in advancing the goals of the CDC Public Health Data Strategy.
CSTE will review all completed fellow applications and conduct virtual interviews of fellow candidates. Accepted candidates will be matched to a State, Territorial, Local, or Tribal (STLT) health department host site, based on a mutual ranking process. Host site placements are limited to the approved host sites. Health departments interested in hosting a fellow will apply to CSTE through a separate application process. Remote, hybrid, and in-person placements may be available. As host sites are accepted, CSTE will make their position descriptions available to applicants.
CSTE is the sponsoring organization for this fellowship program, which is funded by the *CDC Foundation*. All host sites will be STLT health departments.
