Overview
As a Senior Data BSA/Product Associate on the Transactional Data Products team within Enterprise Data and Analytics, you will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from (1) data architecture design to direct business process evolution, (2) backlog prioritization and management, (3) reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution, (4) researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion, and (5) educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.
Beyond these core competencies it will be very important for this candidate to be comfortable working with remote data science professionals. This assignment will be working specifically to support the recent Acquisition of Celect and onboarding them to existing data products as well as eliciting requirements to build new ones.
If youre right for this role, youre a data evangelist with hands-on SQL experience, agile product experience and a basic understanding of data architecture. In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward, and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a big data cloud eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutioning, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a white board for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

Overview
As a Senior Data BSA/Product Associate on the Transactional Data Products team within Enterprise Data and Analytics, you will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from (1) data architecture design to direct business process evolution, (2) backlog prioritization and management, (3) reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution, (4) researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion, and (5) educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.
Beyond these core competencies it will be very important for this candidate to be comfortable working with remote data science professionals. This assignment will be working specifically to support the recent Acquisition of Celect and onboarding them to existing data products as well as eliciting requirements to build new ones.
If youre right for this role, youre a data evangelist with hands-on SQL experience, agile product experience and a basic understanding of data architecture. In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward, and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a big data cloud eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutioning, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a white board for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

Job Description 
Hybrid: This role is categorized as hybrid. This means the successful candidate is expected to report to Concord, NC three times per week, at minimum.

Given the need to support some live race events during weekends, this role will require the ability to work a flexible schedule.

The Role 
The GM Motorsports Program is seeking a strategy analyst dedicated to guiding the development of race strategy tools focused on Formula 1 application. GM Motorsports currently supports our teams in the IndyCar and NASCAR Series with real-time, AI/ML based race strategy tools; a large portion of the initial work will involve merging these existing tools/analysis techniques with free-air simulation methods more commonly in-use throughout the Formula 1 grid. Leveraging these varied approaches and experiences across different series will give this individual an opportunity to be a key part in developing a cutting-edge race-strategy software for the Andretti Cadillac and advance the core GM Motorsports race-strategy platform for IndyCar, NASCAR and Sportscar series. Though the majority of early work will focus on tool development, once tools reach maturity, greater emphasis will need to be placed on effective implementation and application. Throughout the design cycle, the role will require extensive collaboration with internal GM personnel supporting US based series, IT development and data science groups, and Andretti Cadillac personnel.

What You’ll Do 
Apply Data Science and Modeling techniques to develop and refine race strategy tools, facilitating insightful pre-race planning and split-second identification of pivotal strategy inflection points during live race events.

Evolve existing AI/ML models for application in Formula 1: refining existing python code-base where appropriate and reimagining where necessary.
Develop platform for running and interrogating Mote Carlo free-air simulations.
Create tire degradation models, refining parameters and coefficient fits for accurate future predictions.
Conceptualize most efficient means of conveying insights through new visualizations. Prototype working examples and collaborate with IT and software partners to develop production implementations.


Collaborate with diverse technical teams across GM, GM Motorsports and GM sponsored motorsports teams to develop and support race strategy tools and provide analytic guidance.

Co-develop production race strategy software with data science, IT software development and Andretti Cadillac groups.
Work with teammates supporting other racing series to apply analysis techniques and modeling approaches to other series to validate processes and refine models.
Transfer learning and approaches between the series in which GM Motorsports teams compete.


Utilize race strategy tools to verify accuracy, understand performance, and reveal areas for future enhancement. Collaborate with Andretti Cadillac group to implement tools and derive insights for each race event.
