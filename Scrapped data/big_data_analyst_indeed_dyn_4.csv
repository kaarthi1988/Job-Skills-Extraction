Overview
As a Senior Data BSA/Product Associate on the Transactional Data Products team within Enterprise Data and Analytics, you will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence and Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from (1) data architecture design to direct business process evolution, (2) backlog prioritization and management, (3) reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution, (4) researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion, and (5) educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.
Beyond these core competencies it will be very important for this candidate to be comfortable working with remote data science professionals. This assignment will be working specifically to support the recent Acquisition of Celect and onboarding them to existing data products as well as eliciting requirements to build new ones.
If youre right for this role, youre a data evangelist with hands-on SQL experience, agile product experience and a basic understanding of data architecture. In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward, and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a big data cloud eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutioning, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a white board for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

Job Description 
Hybrid: This role is categorized as hybrid. This means the successful candidate is expected to report to Concord, NC three times per week, at minimum.

The Role 
The GM Motorsports Program is seeking a strategy analyst dedicated to guiding the development of race strategy tools focused on Formula 1 application.

Though the majority of early work will focus on tool development, once tools reach maturity, greater emphasis will need to be placed on effective implementation and application. Throughout the design cycle, the role will require extensive collaboration with internal GM personnel supporting US based series, IT development and data science groups, and Andretti Cadillac personnel.

What You’ll Do 
Apply Data Science and Modeling techniques to develop and refine race strategy tools, facilitating insightful pre-race planning and split-second identification of pivotal strategy inflection points during live race events.

Work with teammates supporting other racing series to apply analysis techniques and modeling approaches to other series to validate processes and refine models.
Transfer learning and approaches between the series in which GM Motorsports teams compete.


Utilize race strategy tools to verify accuracy, understand performance, and reveal areas for future enhancement. Collaborate with Andretti Cadillac group to implement tools and derive insights for each race event.
