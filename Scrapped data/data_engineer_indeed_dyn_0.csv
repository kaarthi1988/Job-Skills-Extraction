About Us:
Blockworks is a financial media brand that delivers breaking news and premium insights about digital assets to millions of investors. Our content, newsletters, podcasts, and events provide investors with the critical analysis and information they need to make smarter decisions about digital assets.

 Who You Are:
Software engineering is your passion, and you have special talents focused on data architecture, design, and API development. You are a player-coach and a natural leader who understands the technical and human elements that go into great software design. You have a results-oriented attitude and a passion for delivering flawless releases and developing digital product pipelines (CI/CD pipelines). You have a proven track record facilitating engineering teams to increase productivity and quality.
You're excited at the possibility of helping design and develop our data pipelines as well as leading all of our data-related projects and strategies for Blockwork's suite of projects. You love moving quickly in a fast-paced start-up, but you also bring intentionality, sustainability and scalability to your approach as an engineer.

 What You’ll Do:
As our Senior Data Engineer, you'll be our first data engineer and will be directly responsible for leading the creation and execution of our data models and strategies that feed our product. You'll work collaboratively with other members of the engineering team to design, develop, implement, and evolve our data pipeline and API strategies and approaches.
Every day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:

 Own Data Sourcing Pipelines: You'll be responsible for helping to architect our data warehousing, ingestion, and sourcing strategy, working with multiple SDKs to aggregate data from various sources into Blockwork's own data warehouse.
 Design and Implement ETL Solutions: You'll be responsible for implementing our overall ETL approach, including accessing & setting up blockchain nodes to pull from, sourcing data from 3rd parties, and modeling our internal schemas across our PostgreSQL database(s)
 Grow Shared Knowledge: You'll help provide technical leadership, guidance, and assistance to the team in the implementation of established architectures and designs.
 Drive Operational Efficiency: You'll be constantly looking for opportunities to improve data workflows and reliably automate routine tasks.
 Cross-Functional Collaboration: You'll work with other teams across Blockworks, including Research, Product, and Engineering, to lead initiatives and move collaborations forward.

Experimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.

 What You’ve Done Before:
For this role, first and foremost, you must have significant knowledge of the crypto industry; interest in crypto is not enough, we’re looking for someone who considers themself crypto native. You have at least 4 (but ideally more) years of hands-on experience with data modeling, schema design, data operations, and data warehousing. During that time, you've personally built backend systems at scale with a focus on data processing and ingestion.
You’re an ace at Python, Go, Rust and/or Typescript, and you bring incredibly strong expertise in SQL (ideally Parquet, Postgres, and Clickhouse). You have deep experience creating data warehouses at scale (100M+ rows per day), and you also bring experience using DevOps tools and cloud solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, or GCP.

 It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:
Experience and demonstrated success in crypto, web3, startup, or incubator environments will move you to the top of the list. Having a background in designing, building and managing microservices will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have any significant experience in security, privacy, and scalability, we'd love to hear about that, too.

 Salary:
This is a full-time, exempt position with an expected salary of $160,000 - $200,000/year.

 Benefits:
 Remote-First: We're a remote-first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please.
 100% Medical Coverage for You: Close to fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you, and a significant portion covered for your dependents.
 Flexible PTO: We have a flexible paid time off policy that doesn't limit the number of vacation days you can take.
 Parental Leave: At Blockworks, all team members are eligible for 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave.
 Hardware Stipend: Every team member has a stipend to use to purchase the tools and technology that help them be their most productive.
 Learning & Growth Stipend: Every team member has a stipend to us to spend on their skill growth and professional development.
 Career Growth: We prioritize skill growth and career development, and we have a clear, documented structure to take the guesswork work out of individual development and career progression
 Global & Diverse Team: We're a global team, and we're committed to creating an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture

 Come build with us; we're just getting started!

We know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking. We are dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team and encourage everyone to apply if your experience is close to what we are looking for.
Blockworks is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

Knowledgeable about trade-offs between different chart types and able to make good decisions on how to best represent various types of data.
Passionate about designing, building, and iterating on interfaces, with a strong sense of the entire user experience, not just the individual pieces. Experience working with design prototyping tools like Figma, Adobe XD or Sketch is a plus.
Experienced working with data from a variety of sources, including API endpoints and relational databases.
Motivated to explore new technologies and comfortable with self-directed learning.
Familiar working with data-centric teams on metrics and analytics, and have basic statistical knowledge and intuition.

 You can expect to:

Work on some of the most used internal tools at Netflix, bringing together multiple data sources, metrics and predictive analytics to keep our business informed about how our ads business is performing.
Work with both creative and business stakeholders to rapidly iterate on your initial designs based on user research and feedback.
Partner closely with R&D teams to bring new metrics, models and data sources to Netflix.

About Us:
Blockworks is a financial media brand that delivers breaking news and premium insights about digital assets to millions of investors. Our content, newsletters, podcasts, and events provide investors with the critical analysis and information they need to make smarter decisions about digital assets.

 Who You Are:
Software engineering is your passion, and you have special talents focused on data architecture, design, and API development. You are a player-coach and a natural leader who understands the technical and human elements that go into great software design. You have a results-oriented attitude and a passion for delivering flawless releases and developing digital product pipelines (CI/CD pipelines). You have a proven track record facilitating engineering teams to increase productivity and quality.
You're excited at the possibility of helping design and develop our data pipelines as well as leading all of our data-related projects and strategies for Blockwork's suite of projects. You love moving quickly in a fast-paced start-up, but you also bring intentionality, sustainability and scalability to your approach as an engineer.

 What You’ll Do:
As our Senior Data Engineer, you'll be our first data engineer and will be directly responsible for leading the creation and execution of our data models and strategies that feed our product. You'll work collaboratively with other members of the engineering team to design, develop, implement, and evolve our data pipeline and API strategies and approaches.
Every day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:

 Own Data Sourcing Pipelines: You'll be responsible for helping to architect our data warehousing, ingestion, and sourcing strategy, working with multiple SDKs to aggregate data from various sources into Blockwork's own data warehouse.
 Design and Implement ETL Solutions: You'll be responsible for implementing our overall ETL approach, including accessing & setting up blockchain nodes to pull from, sourcing data from 3rd parties, and modeling our internal schemas across our PostgreSQL database(s)
 Grow Shared Knowledge: You'll help provide technical leadership, guidance, and assistance to the team in the implementation of established architectures and designs.
 Drive Operational Efficiency: You'll be constantly looking for opportunities to improve data workflows and reliably automate routine tasks.
 Cross-Functional Collaboration: You'll work with other teams across Blockworks, including Research, Product, and Engineering, to lead initiatives and move collaborations forward.

Experimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.

 What You’ve Done Before:
For this role, first and foremost, you must have significant knowledge of the crypto industry; interest in crypto is not enough, we’re looking for someone who considers themself crypto native. You have at least 4 (but ideally more) years of hands-on experience with data modeling, schema design, data operations, and data warehousing. During that time, you've personally built backend systems at scale with a focus on data processing and ingestion.
You’re an ace at Python, Go, Rust and/or Typescript, and you bring incredibly strong expertise in SQL (ideally Parquet, Postgres, and Clickhouse). You have deep experience creating data warehouses at scale (100M+ rows per day), and you also bring experience using DevOps tools and cloud solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, or GCP.

 It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:
Experience and demonstrated success in crypto, web3, startup, or incubator environments will move you to the top of the list. Having a background in designing, building and managing microservices will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have any significant experience in security, privacy, and scalability, we'd love to hear about that, too.

 Salary:
This is a full-time, exempt position with an expected salary of $160,000 - $200,000/year.

 Benefits:
 Remote-First: We're a remote-first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please.
 100% Medical Coverage for You: Close to fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you, and a significant portion covered for your dependents.
 Flexible PTO: We have a flexible paid time off policy that doesn't limit the number of vacation days you can take.
 Parental Leave: At Blockworks, all team members are eligible for 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave.
 Hardware Stipend: Every team member has a stipend to use to purchase the tools and technology that help them be their most productive.
 Learning & Growth Stipend: Every team member has a stipend to us to spend on their skill growth and professional development.
 Career Growth: We prioritize skill growth and career development, and we have a clear, documented structure to take the guesswork work out of individual development and career progression
 Global & Diverse Team: We're a global team, and we're committed to creating an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture

 Come build with us; we're just getting started!

We know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking. We are dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team and encourage everyone to apply if your experience is close to what we are looking for.

Job Description




      New York City Emergency Management (NYCEM) helps New Yorkers before, during, and after emergencies through preparedness, education, and response. NYCEM is responsible for coordinating citywide emergency planning and response for all types and scales of emergencies. We are staffed by more than 200 dedicated professionals with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise, including individuals assigned from other City agencies.   The Office of the Chief Operating Officer (COO) is comprised of Human Capital Management (HCM), Information Technology (IT), Support Services, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The Office of the COO is focused on implementing agency initiatives and strategies and incorporating them into daily operations to meet agency objectives and goals.   The NYCEM Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Unit produces reliable location-based information through the integration, analysis, and visualization of essential data distributed in the form of maps, datasets, summary metrics, and associated applications. Guided by the recommendations from the City’s after-action report following the extreme rain event associated with Post-Tropical Cyclone Ida in September 2021, NYCEM is embarking on an Emergency Data Improvement Initiative to more readily and accurately integrate the field data collected after an emergency by various entities assisting in canvassing, response, and recovery operations; to improve data sharing amongst agencies; and to develop new data products for emergency response. The heart of this effort is the establishment of an interagency Emergency Data Governance Committee (EDGC), chaired by NYCEM, with the mission of identifying gaps and obstacles in acquiring and managing the data needed for operational response and situational awareness; critiquing and testing proposed solutions; and establishing standards and protocols for data management and governance. Both organizational and technological solutions will be examined by the committee.  NYCEM has an exciting opportunity for a motivated data professional to join the GIS unit as a Data Engineer. NYCEM is creating a data integration team comprised of data engineering and geospatial experts to help implement EDGC recommendations.

Collaborate with other city agencies to improve base data. As needed, convert base data into more useable form for emergency needs.
Perform exploratory data analyses as needed.
Collaborate with other data engineers on the best technologies to use, with a goal toward building a sustainable, robust framework.
