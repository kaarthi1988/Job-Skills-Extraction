About the Team
OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We believe that achieving our goal requires real world deployment and iteratively updating based on what we learn.
The Intelligence and Investigations team supports this by identifying and investigating misuses of our products – especially new types of abuse. This enables our partner teams to develop data-backed product policies and build scaled safety mitigations. Precisely understanding abuse allows us to safely enable users to build useful things with our products.
 About the Role
As a Data Scientist on the Monitoring Operations team, you will be responsible for building systems to proactively identify abuse on OpenAI’s products. This includes ensuring we have robust monitoring in place for new products, and can sustain monitoring for existing products. You will also respond to critical escalations, especially those that are not caught by our existing safety systems. This will require expert understanding of our products and data, and involves working cross-functionally with product, policy, and engineering teams.
This role is based in our San Francisco office and includes participation in an on-call rotation that will involve resolving urgent escalations outside of normal work hours. Some investigations may involve sensitive content, including sexual, violent, or otherwise-disturbing material.
 In this role, you will:

Scope and implement monitoring requirements for new product launches. This involves working with Product and Policy teams to understand key risks, and working with Engineering teams to ensure we have sufficient data and tooling.
Improve processes to sustain monitoring operations for existing products. This includes developing approaches to automate monitoring subtasks.

 You might thrive in this role if you:

Have at least 4 years of experience doing technical analysis, especially in SQL and Python.
Have experience in trust and safety and/or have worked closely with policy, enforcement, and engineering teams
Have experience with basic data engineering, such as building core tables or writing data pipelines (not expected to build infrastructure or write production code)
Have experience scaling and automating processes, especially with language models


 About OpenAI

About the Team
The Support team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises.
We strive to reduce friction across the customer journey by harnessing the power of AI and LLMs. Our focus is on building knowledge-driven systems that reduce the need for direct customer support interactions, optimizing both self-service and automated solutions. By joining our team, you’ll collaborate with forward-thinking professionals committed to continually improve and evolve the customer experience.
 About the Role
As a Data Scientist focused on Support Knowledge Management at OpenAI, your mission will be to proactively reduce the number of support cases by designing and implementing data-driven, self-fortifying information and knowledge systems. This is not a traditional support data science or knowledge management role: you will push the boundaries of what’s being done in the Customer Support space and build novel AI/LLM solutions that drive self-service, automation, and optimize the experience for customers seeking assistance. You will drive the data analysis, research, strategy, and implementation for turning insights from every customer interaction into knowledge or actionable improvements that continuously enhance our support systems. If successful, what you build can be applied to and expanded to other knowledge structures around OpenAI.
If you thrive in environments that value impact, collaboration, and fast-paced problem-solving, you might be the perfect fit for our team.
This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.
 In this role, you will:



    Harness data from each step of the customer journey (Help Center, chatbot, support cases) to continuously improve the support and customer experience, while building out trust systems to validate information or knowledge updates – e.g. implementing a “reinforcement learning from human feedback” (RLHF) process
   


    Lead the strategy and implementation of a dynamic knowledge base that evolves with customer insights from interactions and resolutions, fortifying the system over time and contributing to increased automation and deflection
   


    Partner with engineering teams to build out the self-fortifying information and knowledge ecosystem, harnessing the power of OpenAI technology and future-proofing our systems for scale
   

 You might thrive in this role if you:



    Have an advanced degree in Data Science, Information Systems, or a related field
   


    Have experience in content or knowledge management systems, knowledge-centered support (KCS) and are passionate about applying it to customer support operations
   


    Possess an understanding of customer support workflows and are familiar with tools like Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce, or similar platforms – but also bring a researcher’s mindset to analyzing and improving these systems.
   


    Are skilled in data science and can derive insights from customer interactions to continuously improve information, knowledge, and systems
   


    Enjoy cross-functional collaboration and working closely with product, engineering, and operations teams to implement cutting-edge solutions
   


    Are a proactive problem-solver and project/program manager, capable of anticipating challenges and designing systems to prevent them.

About the Team
The Support team is central to ensuring that our customers' experience with our products is nothing short of exceptional. We resolve complex issues, provide technical guidance, and support customers in maximizing value and adoption from deploying our products. We work closely with Sales, Technical Success, Product, Engineering and others to deliver the best possible experience to our customers at scale. OpenAI's customers represent a range of diverse backgrounds and maturity, from early-stage startups to established global enterprises.
We strive to reduce friction across the customer journey by harnessing the power of AI and LLMs. Our focus is on building knowledge-driven systems that reduce the need for direct customer support interactions, optimizing both self-service and automated solutions. By joining our team, you’ll collaborate with forward-thinking professionals committed to continually improve and evolve the customer experience.
 About the Role
As a Data Scientist focused on Support Knowledge Management at OpenAI, your mission will be to proactively reduce the number of support cases by designing and implementing data-driven, self-fortifying information and knowledge systems. This is not a traditional support data science or knowledge management role: you will push the boundaries of what’s being done in the Customer Support space and build novel AI/LLM solutions that drive self-service, automation, and optimize the experience for customers seeking assistance. You will drive the data analysis, research, strategy, and implementation for turning insights from every customer interaction into knowledge or actionable improvements that continuously enhance our support systems. If successful, what you build can be applied to and expanded to other knowledge structures around OpenAI.
If you thrive in environments that value impact, collaboration, and fast-paced problem-solving, you might be the perfect fit for our team.
This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.
 In this role, you will:



    Harness data from each step of the customer journey (Help Center, chatbot, support cases) to continuously improve the support and customer experience, while building out trust systems to validate information or knowledge updates – e.g. implementing a “reinforcement learning from human feedback” (RLHF) process
   


    Lead the strategy and implementation of a dynamic knowledge base that evolves with customer insights from interactions and resolutions, fortifying the system over time and contributing to increased automation and deflection
   


    Partner with engineering teams to build out the self-fortifying information and knowledge ecosystem, harnessing the power of OpenAI technology and future-proofing our systems for scale
   

 You might thrive in this role if you:

   SentiLink provides innovative identity and risk solutions, empowering institutions and individuals to transact confidently with one another.
  


   By building the future of identity verification in the United States and reinventing the currently clunky, ineffective, and expensive process, we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.
  


   We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We’ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and have landed on the Forbes Fintech 50 in 2023 and 2024. Last but not least, we’ve even been a part of history - we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives.
  


 Role:
As a Staff Data Scientist at SentiLink, you will build our core products: models that identify fraudsters and also advance our growing suite of products in financial risk. As a senior member you will be relied upon to be a technical leader, mentor and owner of your respective domain, both within the team and the organization. As such you will often work on projects with high visibility and impact that require deep domain understanding, critical thinking and strong technical abilities. You will work with teams across the company to research new types of fraud, develop new products, and provide analysis to drive sales and marketing. This is a full-stack data science role, involving model development, analysis, and writing production code. You should be interested in having end-to-end ownership and a fast-moving environment where deep domain understanding drives development and unusual insights drive our competitive advantage rather than optimization of new machine learning methodologies.
Technologies: Python 3, PostgreSQL, and AWS infrastructure (EC2, S3, RDS, Redshift, etc.)
This is a remote, US-based role.
 Responsibilities:

Develop and maintain SentiLink’s fraud detection models through the full model development lifespan: from data acquisition decisions through featurization, focusing labeling resources, model training, experimentation, productionalization, and monitoring.
Research new types of fraud and develop new SentiLink products around identity verification.
Build foundational modeling to drive SentiLink’s expanding suite of Fraud and Financial Risk products.
Achieve success by researching / developing through iteration, integration of new data sources and inventive feature engineering.
Write production-ready code that can be relied on for real-time decision making by our partners.
Design, perform, and present analyses that will inform data acquisition, product development, risk operations priorities, marketing, and sales efforts.
Work with engineering, risk operations, and data acquisitions to access necessary data, maintain data quality, and support data access.

Requirements:

6+ years relevant work experience & relevant PhD or 8+ years & relevant Masters.
Proven track record of solving complex / high profile business problems with DS / ML solutions.
Experience in communicating outcomes / progress to senior management / stakeholders.
Very strong in “end to end” DS development: Planning, fleshing out success criteria / metrics, getting buy-in, developing the solution, delivering the solution (prod / deck / strategy doc / etc)
Strong practical ML / Stats knowledge, i.e. can easily employ the suite of standard ML / stats tools to quickly scope out solutions, and double down where needed. Experience with SOTA ML solutions is a plus
Interest in developing deep domain expertise for product-focused work: a background in fraud is not required, but willingness to learn is
Experience writing production code and tests Detail oriented and thoughtful 
   - someone we can rely on to make business-changing decisions
Thrive in a fast paced environment characterized by the need to solve extremely varied, high impact, open ended problems.
Bonus for familiarity with: identity solutions, fintech, or adjacent industries
Candidates must be legally authorized to work in the United States and must live in the United States

Salary Range:

$220,000/year - $260,000/year + equity + benefits



Perks:

Employer paid group health insurance for you and your dependents
