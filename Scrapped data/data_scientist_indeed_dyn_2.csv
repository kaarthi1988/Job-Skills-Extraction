   The Wealthfront Data Science Team utilizes our rich financial and behavioral data to influence key product and marketing decisions, as well as to safeguard our clients’ information and assets. The team draws from backgrounds in Computer Science, Natural Sciences, Statistics, Operations Research and Econometrics.
  


 The Data Scientist in this role will be primarily embedded within Wealthfront’s Growth Team. The Growth Team is focused on acquiring new clients, as well as deepening Wealthfront’s relationship to existing clients. The team addresses this mandate by designing creative initiatives that cut across product lines. These initiatives can include testing new in-app features, discovering new channels of client acquisition, launching email campaigns, or targeted incentives – all based on unique insights about our clients and their interaction with the prevailing economic environment.
  


 A fundamental trait for an effective Growth Data Scientist is curiosity for discovering new insights about client behavior. This person will enjoy going deep into the data to understand what’s driving client actions, proposing ideas for new projects and for driving clarity on the ‘why’ behind experiment results.
  


 Technical tools used in this role include Hypothesis testing (potentially with atypical distributions), mathematical transforms of variables, data mining, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). You don't need experience in all of the techniques but must have the ability to pick them up as needed.
  


 Potential project areas for this role include (but are not limited to) analyzing client signup flow, creating client groups according to business rules or automated clustering, creating ML models for estimating incentive revenues or costs and Named Entity Recognition using NLP.
  



Responsibilities



Demonstrate an owner’s mindset in formulation, execution, communication and timing of your projects.
Analyze and explain A/B test experiment results. Investigate why the experiment was a success or a failure. Discover client segments for whom the experiment worked unusually well or otherwise.
Suggest follow ups for recently concluded initiatives and experiments. Create and present rationales for questions including whether the experiment should be continued, and what should be different in the next iteration.
Work closely with Product, Design, Engineering and User Research members on the Growth Team to craft a long term (quarterly) learning plan and subsequently execute your part in that plan.
Collaborate with cross functional stakeholders to come up with feasibility of an experiment, experiment structure and opportunity sizing/impact of the experiment to guide the team’s roadmap.
Work with Data platform teams to procure required (but unavailable) data.
Enhance overall Data Science team execution through hands-on help, design feedback and peer review.






Requirements



A Master's or a PhD degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Operations Research, or Natural Sciences with 4+ years of prior experience in a Data Science role. Exceptions to these requirements may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Prior experience in Growth or Marketing
Prior experience analyzing complex experiments, including developing data insights and data backed recommendations for stakeholders.
Strong communication, storytelling and collaboration skills and a record of partnering across organizations to sharpen project requirements. Sometimes this includes re-framing the original request to solve a more general problem with similar effort.
Hands-on mathematical and software engineering skills to execute on complex projects.
Proficiency in Python and SQL.
Desire and ability to mentor junior Data Scientists within the team by exemplifying math, engineering and technical communication skills.






   Estimated annual salary range: $165,000 - $185,000 USD plus equity and a discretionary bonus.
  


 Benefits include medical, vision, dental, 401K plan, generous time off, parental leave, wellness reimbursements, professional development, employee investing discount, and more!
  


 About Wealthfront



 Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built one of the first automated investment products that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee. We then expanded. We now work with partner banks to offer exceptional banking features through a Wealthfront Brokerage Cash Account, which makes it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $70 billion of our client’s hard earned money, pioneering the robo-advisor category and transforming the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.
  


 Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially in a way that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.

 We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

Pit.AI Technologies is taking on one of the most exciting challenges of our time, namely solving intelligence, in one of the most competitive industries ever, investment management!
The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

 Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

 This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

 The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

 Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

 We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

 Requirements:

Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.
No finance or machine learning experience is required.

Individuals who transfer to the ODNI from a non-GS pay scale will have base pay converted to the appropriate GS grade and step as determined by the Director/ Human Resource Management.  On occasional instances when a current federal civilian employee applies for an ODNI position that is a lower grade than his or her personal grade, the candidate's personal grade will be downgraded to the grade of the advertised ODNI position and pay will be set at the step that is closest to but not less than the employee's current annual base rate of pay, not to exceed the maximum rate (i.e., step 10) of the GS grade to which assigned.
