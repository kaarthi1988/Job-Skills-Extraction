Location: Lincoln, MA or Remote
Employment Type: Full-time
Citizenship: US Citizens only
Notes: Direct Hire. No third-party assistance is approved for this role.
About The Job: At Jaxon, we are on a mission to make AI trustworthy. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in corporate settings is hindered by the “hallucination problem,” where AI models produce inaccurate or entirely fabricated responses. For regulated industries and high-risk applications, this issue is preventing LLM use altogether. This role is crucial in overcoming these challenges.
As a Machine Learning Engineer at Jaxon, you will be responsible for developing and implementing machine learning models and algorithms to create more reliable AI systems. You will play a key role in delivering complex AI-driven solutions for customers, with a particular focus on defense applications as Jaxon is dual-use.
We have a patent pending product, Domain-Specific AI Logic (DSAIL), that forms the basis of most of our deployments. This role will be focused on increasing security and reliability for our customers through implementing DSAIL and building on its capabilities. A particular emphasis is placed on addressing the fundamental limitations of LLMs – they don’t understand context and logical reasoning. Once an LLM deviates from the right path, errors are more likely to occur. Training an AI away from this type of yes/no logic and into more human-like reasoning is at the core of this position.
The basics of this role requires the ability to:

Collaborate Across Teams: Work with cross-functional teams to integrate ML models into our existing systems and workflows, enhancing product capabilities.
Optimize Data Processing and Model Performance: Conduct comprehensive data management including preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to improve accuracy and efficiency.
Technical Proficiency: Demonstrate solid machine learning engineering experience, particularly with NLP applications and unstructured data in a cloud environment. Fluency in Python is essential.
Understand Machine Learning Models: Needs to be intimately familiar with the process, but deploying ML models will not be a regular part of the job.

Soft Skills:

Able to context switch as needed
Able to compartmentalize different projects with different goals
Able to communicate clearly and precisely - not just abstractions and ""lines-and-boxes""

Specific Technologies:

Docker, Docker Compose
Python
Python Data Science Stack - NumPy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Various deep learning packages
Familiarity with calling web API's and making web API's
Familiarity with modular architectures - IPC, publish-subscribe, etc…

Nice-To-Haves:

Familiarity with predicate logic
Familiarity with Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) notation for language grammars
Lisp languages

About Jaxon: Jaxon is a leading provider of machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions. We are committed to helping our customers solve complex problems with AI. Our products and services are used by businesses of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies.
What Makes Jaxon Different?

Human First: Our leaders get it — life happens. Whether it’s flexible working hours or understanding the need for a mental health day, we prioritize your well-being. Our CEO recognizes that happy people do the best work and he backs that up with an empathetically led culture – and I’m not just saying that because he’s going to read this post.
Laid-Back Culture: We know that the best work comes from a place of comfort and authenticity. At Jaxon, you’re encouraged to be yourself, dress casually, and embrace your quirky side. It’s just one of the benefits of being an early-stage, high-growth startup.
Tech Lover's Dream: From hackathons to tech talks with industry leaders, we fuel our passion for innovation with constant learning and development opportunities.
Grunt Work to Grand Projects: Every task you tackle, big or small, matters. You think I’m writing job descriptions for fun? Sometimes things need to get done and it’s an all hands on deck situation to get them to the finish line. We're looking for team players who understand that achieving groundbreaking AI innovations sometimes involves rolling up your sleeves to tackle the essential, yet less glamorous tasks.
​​Excited about the prospect of free snacks, massages, and a hot tub at the office? You might have to keep looking, as we're a fully remote team. However, if you ever feel the need to switch up your work environment, you’re always welcome at our office space in Lincoln, Massachusetts—includes a dartboard for slow afternoons.

Added Perks:

Unlimited PTO: (seriously!)
Comprehensive benefits: Health, dental, and vision insurance
Competitive Salary: We provide competitive compensation packages commensurate with experience
Stock Options: All compensation plans include stock options - join now and benefit from future acquisitions
Holidays Off: ALL federal holidays are paid time off.

About You: You're the type of person who's naturally driven—not necessarily because you built a rocket in your backyard as a kid, but because you have a genuine curiosity about the world of technology. In your spare time, you might find yourself deep-diving into technology subreddits, following the latest industry trends, or exploring which companies are innovating and how. Your passion isn't just about staying informed; it's about thinking how you can take these emerging concepts and scale them up, make them faster, or more impactful. At Jaxon, we're looking for someone who sees a baseline and instinctively wants to build beyond it. If you’re ready to take what exists and make it extraordinary, you’ll fit right in.
The engineering team at Jaxon warned me that all engineers hate when job descriptions specify bullet lists of X years of experience in technology Y such that time_exists(Y) < X. With that being said, there are no hard tech requirements, but experience with the python ML ecosystem and with LLMs is expected. Additionally:

You should have a comfort level building and training models, not just calling cloud APIs, but you’re resourceful enough to recognize when you can use cloud APIs whenever you can get away with it.
You aren’t afraid of digesting academic papers, but you understand that it’s code that matters.
You’re going to need proven expertise in building ML applications.
Proficient Python including demonstrable experience with libraries relevant to data manipulation.
Ideally some experience with machine learning, in particular NLP applications.
You are primarily in a development role, but are comfortable being customer-facing when needed.
Active security clearance is a bonus.

We are looking for somebody who thrives in an environment where day-to-day priorities and tasks may rapidly change. The role is not a fit if you value ""business as usual"".
We value team members who are bold enough to pitch creative ideas, even if they're still rough around the edges or might not make the final cut.
Education and Length of Experience
Preferably applicants will have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or similar, however at Jaxon, we value skills and dedication over degrees. We strongly encourage people without degrees to apply if you have at least 5 years of experience.
Jaxon is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, or Veteran status.

We are known as a leader in the IT Training industry. With that said, we are still a small company at heart, with just 35 employees. We rely heavily on independent contract trainers. We consider them an integral part of our team, and we treat them that way.
Our contract trainers work remotely from their own home office teaching live, instructor led classes to adult learners around the country. Class sizes are small-rarely more than 12. ONLC provides excellent remote technical and customer service support during class, so that our instructors can stay focused on what's important--delivering a top-notch class!
We are always adding new offerings, so we encourage you to look over the full list of classes on our public schedule--www.onlc.com. Right now, we're in need of experienced, enthusiastic instructors to teach AI related classes. AI is changing very quickly. New AI tools are being released all the time. The technology already out there is being updated often, sometimes without warning. The need for these instructors to be fully engrossed in what's happening in the world of AI, willing to stay current, and be able to handle a high level of change is critical in this fast-paced environment.
The specific AI technologies will change over time. At this time, a high level of knowledge in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI foundation models is important. Knowledge of automation tools such as Make, Zapier and Power Apps is a major plus.
In addition to our public schedule, we also conduct private and custom classes both remotely and at corporate client locations. If you are able to occasionally travel within the US, that's a big plus, but not a deal breaker. Experience working with salespeople and clients to customize classes is also very helpful.
