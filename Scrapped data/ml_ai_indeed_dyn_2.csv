We are known as a leader in the IT Training industry. With that said, we are still a small company at heart, with just 35 employees. We rely heavily on independent contract trainers. We consider them an integral part of our team, and we treat them that way.
Our contract trainers work remotely from their own home office teaching live, instructor led classes to adult learners around the country. Class sizes are small-rarely more than 12. ONLC provides excellent remote technical and customer service support during class, so that our instructors can stay focused on what's important--delivering a top-notch class!
We are always adding new offerings, so we encourage you to look over the full list of classes on our public schedule--www.onlc.com. Right now, we're in need of experienced, enthusiastic instructors to teach AI related classes. AI is changing very quickly. New AI tools are being released all the time. The technology already out there is being updated often, sometimes without warning. The need for these instructors to be fully engrossed in what's happening in the world of AI, willing to stay current, and be able to handle a high level of change is critical in this fast-paced environment.
The specific AI technologies will change over time. At this time, a high level of knowledge in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI foundation models is important. Knowledge of automation tools such as Make, Zapier and Power Apps is a major plus.
In addition to our public schedule, we also conduct private and custom classes both remotely and at corporate client locations. If you are able to occasionally travel within the US, that's a big plus, but not a deal breaker. Experience working with salespeople and clients to customize classes is also very helpful.

We are known as a leader in the IT Training industry. With that said, we are still a small company at heart, with just 35 employees. We rely heavily on independent contract trainers. We consider them an integral part of our team, and we treat them that way.
Our contract trainers work remotely from their own home office teaching live, instructor led classes to adult learners around the country. Class sizes are small-rarely more than 12. ONLC provides excellent remote technical and customer service support during class, so that our instructors can stay focused on what's important--delivering a top-notch class!
We are always adding new offerings, so we encourage you to look over the full list of classes on our public schedule--www.onlc.com. Right now, we're in need of experienced, enthusiastic instructors to teach AI related classes. AI is changing very quickly. New AI tools are being released all the time. The technology already out there is being updated often, sometimes without warning. The need for these instructors to be fully engrossed in what's happening in the world of AI, willing to stay current, and be able to handle a high level of change is critical in this fast-paced environment.
The specific AI technologies will change over time. At this time, a high level of knowledge in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI foundation models is important. Knowledge of automation tools such as Make, Zapier and Power Apps is a major plus.
In addition to our public schedule, we also conduct private and custom classes both remotely and at corporate client locations. If you are able to occasionally travel within the US, that's a big plus, but not a deal breaker. Experience working with salespeople and clients to customize classes is also very helpful.

About Aleph
Aleph is redefining the world of Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A). We operate in an established software category with a multi-billion TAM but no clear winner. We’re here to change that, and our early results are self-explanatory.
Aleph was founded by Albert Gozzi and Santiago Perez De Rosso, two technical founders with backgrounds from Stanford and MIT and experience working at top-tier companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Bain & Company. We’re backed by top VCs (Bain Capital Ventures, Khosla Ventures, YC, Picus Capital), and work with customers like Turo, Notion, Zapier, and others.
What we’ve built so far is the most seamless way to centralize all of a company's financial data – think expenses from Quickbooks or Netsuite, pipeline forecasts from Salesforce – and bring it into the tools finance teams are already using. But the vision goes way beyond that. We’re building the source of truth for a business’ data, and ultimately the platform businesses use to make better decisions.
We’re way ahead of schedule due to our unique approach, with barely any churn and rapid growth with very low marketing spend to date.
We are hiring remotely across the Americas (Canada, LATAM, United States).

 What we're looking for
We are seeking our first AI-focused software engineers to lead the development of Artificial Intelligence features across our web app & add-ins. You will work on determining how to best incorporate large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies into our product. You will work closely with our product and design teams to explore the boundaries of what’s possible with AI, find innovative ways to apply the technology to Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A), and ship features with a significant impact on our users' workflows.

 What you'll be doing

Work hand-in-hand with leadership and other teammates to prioritize and execute on our product roadmap
Own the development of new AI features end-to-end, from prototype to implementation in our core product
Deliver robust, scalable, and well-tested code
Help develop and establish best practices to lay the foundation for a high-performing technology team and its culture
Collaborate with Design and Operation teams to keep making Aleph better every day


 What you have

3+ years of full-time software development experience, including React
1+ years of experience contributing to the system design or architecture (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new or existing systems
Product mindset—you're comfortable and eager to meet customers and develop an empathetic understanding of their problems to ensure we're building the right solutions
Solid background in algorithms and data structures
Experience with AI platforms and technologies, including generative models and LLMs
Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams and stakeholders
Previous startup experience, or experience thriving in an unstructured environment
Experience with a B2B SaaS product, analytics, or building tools for Finance teams
Exposure or interest in Finance, with emphasis in FP&A


While this is a remote-first opportunity, we're focusing on candidates within the Americas to better align with our working hours as a team.
Aleph is an equal opportunity employer that is committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We prohibit discrimination and harassment of any kind based on race, color, sex, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, genetic information, pregnancy, or any other protected characteristic as outlined by federal, state, or local laws.
 This policy applies to all employment practices within our organization, including hiring, recruiting, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, leave of absence, compensation, benefits, training, and apprenticeship. Aleph makes hiring decisions based solely on qualifications, merit, and business needs at the time.

WHO WE LOOK FOR
An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.
As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.
