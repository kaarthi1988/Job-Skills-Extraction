Our contract trainers work remotely from their own home office teaching live, instructor led classes to adult learners around the country. Class sizes are small-rarely more than 12.

The technology already out there is being updated often, sometimes without warning. The need for these instructors to be fully engrossed in what's happening in the world of AI, willing to stay current, and be able to handle a high level of change is critical in this fast-paced environment.
The specific AI technologies will change over time. At this time, a high level of knowledge in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI foundation models is important. Knowledge of automation tools such as Make, Zapier and Power Apps is a major plus.
In addition to our public schedule, we also conduct private and custom classes both remotely and at corporate client locations. If you are able to occasionally travel within the US, that's a big plus, but not a deal breaker. Experience working with salespeople and clients to customize classes is also very helpful.

  At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers.
