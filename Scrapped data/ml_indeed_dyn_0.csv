We are known as a leader in the IT Training industry. With that said, we are still a small company at heart, with just 35 employees. We rely heavily on independent contract trainers. We consider them an integral part of our team, and we treat them that way.
Our contract trainers work remotely from their own home office teaching live, instructor led classes to adult learners around the country. Class sizes are small-rarely more than 12. ONLC provides excellent remote technical and customer service support during class, so that our instructors can stay focused on what's important--delivering a top-notch class!
We are always adding new offerings, so we encourage you to look over the full list of classes on our public schedule--www.onlc.com. Right now, we're in need of experienced, enthusiastic instructors to teach AI related classes. AI is changing very quickly. New AI tools are being released all the time. The technology already out there is being updated often, sometimes without warning. The need for these instructors to be fully engrossed in what's happening in the world of AI, willing to stay current, and be able to handle a high level of change is critical in this fast-paced environment.
The specific AI technologies will change over time. At this time, a high level of knowledge in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other AI foundation models is important. Knowledge of automation tools such as Make, Zapier and Power Apps is a major plus.
In addition to our public schedule, we also conduct private and custom classes both remotely and at corporate client locations.

HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.



 Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).



 Even if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN. You’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger, as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.



 The Enterprise Research team at HUMAN is dedicated to protecting the internet by disrupting the economics of cybercrime. Our team of Data Scientists research and develop algorithms to detect bots and fight fraud. We use statistical and machine learning techniques, in both offline and real-time infrastructures, to provide our customers with proactive security and insights into their attacks.
  

   We’re looking for a Data Scientist to join our team to support the full-cycle of fraud fighting: from the early stages of gathering business requirements and exploratory research to the development and deployment in production of statistical detection techniques. This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers.
  




 What you'll do: 



Partner with Product, Engineering, and Analysts to support our business goals in improving bot detection, building out competitive product features, and optimizing our data and ML infrastructure.
Research and experiment with the latest detection frameworks in cyber security and fraud, statistical techniques, and ML tooling.
Support the growth of best practices and Data Science standards in detection and modeling.
Lead large scale projects and drive change that impacts not just yourself, but the Data Scientists and analysts around you and across our Business Units.
Contribute to our growing DS toolsets, that ‘creating tau’ (disproportionate leverage) by accelerating our team’s ability to find fraud, automating cumbersome tasks, and creating novel methodologies. by empowering the other humans around you.






Who you are:



You have experience solving large-scale, data-intensive problems in production systems (we process trillions of events per day, so literacy with large datasets is a must!).
You can explain the nuances of different statistical modeling approaches and make informed decisions on which to use, whilst also having the engineering awareness of the realities of shipping working code to customers.
You have the ability to think 3 steps ahead in designing a data driven product, bring clarity to problems with ambiguity, and bring simplicity to problems with complexity.
You are proficient with Python and SQL and familiar with related tools, libraries and platforms. You are fluent in Object Oriented development and have strong debugging skills.
You have a good sense of ownership which drives you to find ways to do things better, faster, and leaner; you hold yourself accountable for the quality and accuracy of your work.
You have experience working on cross-functional projects, with multiple stakeholders - both technical and non-technical; and following SDLC best practices: project management, version control, unit testing, and CI/CD.






   The base pay range for this position is $165,000- $205,000 which can include additional on-target bonus and/or incentives. The base pay offered may vary depending on location, job related knowledge, skills, and experience. Stock options and other incentive pay may be provided as part of the compensation package, in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits, depending on the position ultimately offered.
  


 HUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is (we have many). We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!



 With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia.



 We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for wellbeing and learning & development, and a one time home office setup stipend. We also offer weekly lunches, dedicated time off, no-meeting Fridays (for our U.S. and Intl. based HUMANs), HUMAN days, and so much more.



 We’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life. Taking care of one another is part of the HUMAN experience and how we build true HUMAN connections.



 If you are an individual with a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please contact us directly.
